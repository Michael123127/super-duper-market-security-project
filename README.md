# super-duper-market-security-project

This project was conducted as part of my cybersecurity training at HackerU. The goal was to perform security testing on an online grocery platform ("Super Duper Market") to identify potential vulnerabilities and demonstrate their impact.

During the assessment, I discovered and successfully exploited a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, enabling the execution of unauthorized scripts and extraction of sensitive information from the server.

The full project details, including methodology, findings, and recommendations, are documented in the attached PDF report.
